# Django-Web-Applications
Hello everyone! After reading the Django Tuturial online and following the instructions to create a sample Poll application, 
I created my first web application project, which allows users to play the word game Hangman locally on a website. This project is inspired by one of my course projects for a Python programming course on MIT OpenCourseWare.

Here is the instructions about how to open the website: (for Mac OS)

1. Install Python 3.6 or above.

2. Install Pipenv and Postgres (by running "pip install pipenv" and "pip install Postgres").

3. Clone this respository by running "git clone https://github.com/2017soft/Django-Web-Applications.git" on Terminal so that
   you can open the website locally

4. Once having a local version of the respository "Django-Web-Applications", cd into this respository.

5. Run "cd first_django_project" and then "cd mysite".

6. Run "Python manage.py runserver".

7. Open the website using the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/hangman/

8. Read the instruction on the homepage so that you can start playing the game!

9. If you want to quit the server, enter "CONTROL-C" on the command line.
